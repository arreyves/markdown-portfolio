I'm a Geoscientist and Data Enthusiast; I enjoy helping people make sense of their data for informed decision making and building data products; I do this by combining data analysis and operations research methodologies into a unified workflow as an R Shiny Developer. I'm also a co-founder of [AbbaTek Group Inc.](https://abbatekgroup.com/), we are driven by Community Science initiatives whose manin goal is to create that perfect harmony between science and communities. I'm an instructor and open source contributor with [The Carpentries](https://carpentries.org/)[R Geospatial](https://github.com/fishtree-attempt/r-raster-vector-geospatial)lesson. 
I sometimes run my experiments using R and Fortran on high performance and high throughput computing infrastructure but ocassionally also work with Python, HTML, and CSS. I'm currently learning Java and JavaScript. 


Here are some of the fun stuff I enjoy working on:
* Earth monitoring data
* Modelling and data Visualization
* Machine Learning and Decision Science
* Data products, Maps and APIs 
* Bayesian statistics
